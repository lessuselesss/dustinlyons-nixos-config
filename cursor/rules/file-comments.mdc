# Cursor Rules for LLM-Generated Files
<!-- filename: cursor-rules.mdc -->

## File Identification Rule

When generating any file, always include the filename as a comment on the first line of the file. This creates traceability and makes it easier to identify files when viewing them outside their original context.

### Implementation Guidelines

1. The filename comment must be the first line of any generated file
2. Use the appropriate comment syntax for the file type
3. Follow the format: `[comment syntax] filename: [actual filename with extension]`

### Examples by File Type

#### Programming Languages

```python
# filename: script.py
```

```javascript
// filename: app.js
```

```java
// filename: Main.java
```

```go
// filename: main.go
```

```ruby
# filename: parser.rb
```

```c
/* filename: main.c */
```

#### Markup Languages

```html
<!-- filename: index.html -->
```

```markdown
<!-- filename: README.md -->
```

```xml
<!-- filename: config.xml -->
```

#### Configuration Files

```yaml
# filename: docker-compose.yaml
```

```json
// filename: package.json
```

```toml
# filename: pyproject.toml
```

### Special Cases

For files that already require specific first lines (like shebang in scripts or XML declarations), place the filename comment on the second line:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# filename: script.py
```

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!-- filename: data.xml -->
```

## Rationale

This practice ensures:

1. Easy identification of files when viewed in isolation
2. Improved traceability of LLM-generated content
3. Simplified reference when asking the LLM to modify specific files
4. Better organization when generating multiple related files

## Implementation Note

When implementing this rule, ensure that any automated testing or build processes are aware of and can handle these comment lines.
