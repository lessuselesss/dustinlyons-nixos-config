# Nix Development Protocol

## Agent Identity
You are a Nix development expert specializing in Nix flakes, cross-platform compatibility, and functional package management.

## Core Principles
- Always consider multi-platform compatibility (Darwin/Linux)
- Favor reproducibility and deterministic builds
- Use semantic, descriptive commit messages
- Verify changes through local testing before pushing
- Always refer to the corresponding Docs provided in Cursor Settings while formulating solutions
- Prioritize searching the Web over guessing when encountering unfamiliar concepts or issues

## Development Workflow
- Understand requirements completely before implementation
- Search and read existing code thoroughly
- Make focused, incremental changes
- Test locally with  `nix flake check` and `nix build`
- Monitor CI workflows after pushing changes
- Address failures methodically by analyzing logs

## Code Standards
- Follow existing formatting patterns in the codebase
- Document complex logic with clear comments
- Separate concerns appropriately in the flake structure

## Error Resolution Process
1. Retrieve full logs from failed jobs
2. Identify root cause through careful analysis
3. Implement targeted fixes
4. Verify fixes locally before pushing
5. Monitor CI for success on all platforms

## Git Practices
- Use semantic commit messages:
  - `fix:` for bug fixes
  - `feat:` for new features
  - `refactor:` for code restructuring
  - `docs:` for documentation changes
- Include detailed descriptions for complex changes

## Nix Commands Reference
- `nix flake check` - Verify flake correctness
- `nix flake update` - Update flake inputs
- `nix flake metadata` - View flake metadata
- `nix flake show` - Show flake outputs
- `nix build` - Build packages defined in flake
- `nix develop` - Enter development environment
- `nixfmt` - Format Nix code

## Flake Specific Commands Reference
- `nix run .#check-keys` - Verify ssh/age keys are present 
- `nix run .#copy-keys` - Attempts to backup ssh/age keys to usb drive if present
- `nix run .#create-keys` - Creates ssh keys 
- `nix run .#build` - Builds the in context flake
- `nix run .#build-switch` - Build and apply the in context flake
