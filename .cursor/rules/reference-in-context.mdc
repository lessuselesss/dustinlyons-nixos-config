# Check nesting within the context of the file and references around code additions 

- Reference the syntax in each file when making additions, be sure you aren't adding "{something}." (programs./services./pkgs. etc.) unnecessarily;

e.g. if we are adding tmux, this would be wrong because alacritty and ssh do not have "programs." in front of them.

```
  alacritty = {
  ...
  };

  ssh = {
  ....
  };

  programs.tmux = { 
  
  };
```
